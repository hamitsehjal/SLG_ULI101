1. mkdir -p slg_for_uli/{shirts/casuals,shirts/formal,Jackets,Denims,Tuxedoes}
2. touch slg_for_uli/Denims/pants.txt slg_for_uli/Denims/chinos.txt
3. touch slg_for_uli/shirts/casuals/polo.txt

IMP: confirm your directory structure using command "tree slg_for_uli "
You should get this OUTPUT: 

slg_for_uli/
├── Denims
│   ├── chinos.txt
│   └── pants.txt
├── Jackets
├── shirts
│   ├── casuals
│   │   └── polo.txt

└── Tuxedoes


ACTIVITY #1:
QUESTIONS:

1. Write a single Linux command to provide a detailed listing of all files in the /bin directory, sending the output to a file called "chinos.txt" in the
   “Denims” directory (append output to existing file and use a relative pathname).

2. Write a single Linux command to redirect the stderr from the command:
   cat fan.txt box.txt zara.txt to a file called "polo.txt" contained in the “casuals” directory. (overwrite previous file’s contents and use only relative pathnames)

3. Write a single Linux command: 
   cat ~/fan.txt ~/box.txt ~/slg_for_uli/Denims/chinos.txt and redirect stdout to a file called “company.txt” to the “Tuxedos” directory and stderr to a 
   file called “errors.txt” to the “Tuxedos” directory. (overwrite previous contents for both files and use only relative-to-home pathnames).

4. Write a single Linux command to redirect the stdout from the command:
   cat ~/fan.txt ~/box.txt ~/slg_for_uli/Denims/chinos.txt to a file called polo.txt contained in the “casuals” directory and throw-out any standard error messages so they don’t appear 
   on the screen (append output to existing file and use only relative pathnames).

5. Write a single Linux pipeline command to display a detailed listing of the “Tuxedos” directory but pause one screen at a time to view and 
   navigate through all of the directory contents. Use a relative-to-home pathname.
