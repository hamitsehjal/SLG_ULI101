1. Write a Bash Shell script "login.sh" that does the following task in order:

	- Clears the screen

	- Displays "My username is: <YOUR-USERNAME>" (Make sure that you use environment variable to get the username and not a Unix/Linux Command)

	- Display "Other users logged into system are: <LIST OF ALL USERS>" (HINT: use Command Substitution here!!)

	- Prompts for a username and store it in a variable "username". (IMP: Do Not use "echo" command)

	- Prompt for a password and store it in a variable "password" in a single line. (IMP: Must include "echo" command in addition to any other command used)

	- Display "valid user" if username is equals to "admin" and password is equals to "secret". Otherwise Display "invalid user"
